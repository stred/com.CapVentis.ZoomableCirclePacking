com.CapVentis.ZoomableCirclePacking
===================================

Releasing this implementation of the d3 zoomable Circle Packing (http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/7607535) for Qlik Sense.

This has a nice effect where, when we zoom, it makes the  partial selection.  
However, if we zoom down again there is an issue where multiple selections can be made - probably because of a change in the underlying dataset.
